Dear Prof. Goycoolea,

We are graduate students in the department of ISE in Lehigh University, United States. Recently, we are studying your paper named 'On the exact separation of mixed integer knapsack cuts' in 2012 and are attacted to the section 3 about 'Solving the mixed integer knapsack problem'. Both of us are quite interested in this topic and hope to explore your algorithms not only by our curiosity, but also for a project that is required for our 'Integer Programming' course.

However, after studying your theoretical results, we are in trouble when implementing your algorithm correctly. unfortunitely, we couldn't get the expected solution on the test problems using our own implementation. The reason might be that we missed some details. Typically, we didn't find out the strategy you used for branching. Also, to apply the idea of domination, do we need to compute cost domination tuples for every pair of variables in x? Besides, to test our implemention, where can we find those instances you called "MIKP_hard"? 

We've attached our uncompleted code below. Could you please give us some suggestion? If possible, would you mind allowing us to have a look at your implementation? 

Thank you so much and we look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,
Chenxin Ma, Xi He
